# Cash-flow Monitor

Cash-flow Monitor is a web application designed to help users track their expenses and gain control over their spending habits. 
It was created to address personal struggles with overspending on non-essentials, such as junk food and unnecessary purchases. 
By tracking expenses and providing feedback, this tool helps users become more aware of their financial decisions, reduce wasteful spending, and improve their spending habits.

## Features

- **Expense Tracking:** Cash-flow Monitor allows users to record their expenses and analyze where their money is going.

- **Dual Feedback System:** Users can add expenses to two categories, "Notpurchase" for items they resisted purchasing and "Purchase" for items they regret buying.
  This dual feedback system helps users reflect on their spending decisions.

- **User Registration:** Users without being registered can also use this tool. However, I strongly recommend creating an account for a more reliable and personalized experience.

- **OAuth Authentication:** Cash-flow Monitor provides OAuth authentication, allowing users to log in securely with their Google account without hassle.
